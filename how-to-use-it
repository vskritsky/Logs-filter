This filter was manually tested on Python 2.7.1. But it should work on newer versions as well. 

You will need those dependencies installed:
-NumPy;
-Pandas;
-OS;

Create in you python directory a folder \Data, where the filter will search for all the .txt files. 

In case you have any question regarding how this filter works, please, do not hesitate to contact me on vadim.skritkii@yahoo.com.
